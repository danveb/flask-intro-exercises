Set Up Your Project
Download the starter code. You’ll get a directory with two directories in it:
flask-greet-calc/
  greet/
  calc/

At the top level of this (inside flask-greet-calc), create a virtual environment:
$ python3 -m venv venv

Start using your venv:
$ source venv/bin/activate
(env) $

Install Flask:
(env) $ pip3 install flask
...

Make a “requirements.txt” file in this directory with a listing of all the software needed for this project:
(env) $ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
(you can look at that file with cat requirements.txt)

Set Up Git
We want you to add this project to Git, so let’s make our project a Git repository:
(env) $ git init

Then, since we don’t want the venv/ folder put into Git (or send to GitHub), put it in a file called .gitignore (notice the leading dot!). Inside that file should be this line:
.gitignore

venv/
(which means “ignore all folders named venv/ anywhere here and below, as far as git is concerned”)

You should test that Git is ignoring this file by making sure it doesn’t appear as an untracked file in git status:

(env) $ git status
